Great question! The short answer is:
**Not always** â€” using recursion **does not guarantee** better time complexity than an iterative approach. In fact, recursion can sometimes be **worse** due to function call overhead and redundant computations, **unless** it's optimized with techniques like **memoization**.

However, there **are cases** where recursion combined with optimization can give you a better solution than naive iteration.

### âœ… Example Where Recursion is Better (with Memoization)

**Fibonacci Number:**

#### Iterative Approach (naive)
```java
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    int a = 0, b = 1, c = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
    return c;
}
```
**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

#### Recursive (without memoization â€“ bad!)
```java
int fib(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```
**Time Complexity:** `O(2^n)` â€“ exponential and very slow!

#### Recursive with Memoization (Good!)
```java
Map<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();

int fib(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    if (memo.containsKey(n)) return memo.get(n);
    int result = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    memo.put(n, result);
    return result;
}
```
**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
âœ… As good as iterative but much cleaner for some problems.

### âœ… Example Where Recursion Shines: Tree Traversals

For problems like tree traversal (DFS), recursion naturally fits and can be cleaner:

#### Recursive Inorder Traversal
```java
void inorder(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) return;
    inorder(root.left);
    System.out.print(root.val + " ");
    inorder(root.right);
}
```

Writing this iteratively requires a stack and is more complex.
So here recursion gives **same time complexity**, but better readability.

### ðŸ”¥ Bottom Line:

- **Recursion â‰  faster by default.**
- **Use recursion + memoization** in problems with overlapping subproblems (like DP).
- In problems like tree/graph traversal or backtracking, recursion gives **cleaner and manageable** code.
- Iteration is generally more **space-efficient**.
